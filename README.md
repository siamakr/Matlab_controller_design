# Matlab_controller_design

This is a matlab script based on Emil Jacobsson's work on his master's thesis. 
I converted his script which was designed for a 4-fin UAV vehicle, to a TVC vehicle. 

This script produces the LQR gains for the desired controller and creates PZ-map figures
and step response graphs. 

Thanks again to Emil for his constant help in the development of this UAV.
